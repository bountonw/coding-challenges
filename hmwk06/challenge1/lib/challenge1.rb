# ## Code Challenge 1:  Balanced Parenthesis (i.e. {[( )

# - Write a function which determines whether or not a string of characters are
#   balanced.  Thus, your Ruby program should return `true` if it's balanced and
#   `false` otherwise.

#   In order to complete this challenge, all specs must pass and you can run them
#   by doing the following:

#   ```
#   $ unzip homework-06.zip
#   $ cd /path/to/homework-06/challenge1
#   $ rspec
#   ```

#   The expected output is as follows:

#   ```
#   .......

  def self.balanced?(_string)
    # your implementation goes here
